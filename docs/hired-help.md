# Hired Help
Difficult as it is to imagine anyone willingly subjecting themselves to be under the employ of an adventurer, such strange occurrences do happen, and with alarming frequency too! A good thing, then, for without the exploitation of human capital no adventurer could ever hope for even a modicum of success.

There are four different categories of hired help: hirelings, retainers, mercenaries, and specialists.
## Hirelings
NPCs can be hired to help PC’s during their adventures. Hirelings will go on adventures with a PC, but will not participate in combat.

Hirelings, unless otherwise noted, have a 8 in each attribute, 6 Morale, 1d6 stamina and 10 inventory slots. A hireling can be hired for the price listed in the table below.
1. ***Porter***: Will bear torches, shields, and any other equipment or luggage a PC chooses to saddle them with. They have 5 more inventory slots than normal.
2. ***Teamster***: Drives vehicles in the wilderness and secures the load of pack animals. Pack animals that are not being ridden have an extra 20 inventory slots, and vehicles are less likely to be damaged. A teamster can manage up to 10 animals at once.
3. ***Explorer***: When traveling with the party in an area with which they are familiar, the navigation check is skipped. They will also note any points of interest and answer questions about the area.

## Retainers
Retainers are NPCs who will delve into dungeons to adventure and engage in combat. Retainers are more or less devoted followers of a character, and act under their direction. A retainer can be hired for a half share of treasure, and their upkeep costs covered. They will also usually require a minimum upfront payment of 50p, increasing based on the retainer's talents and experience. The employer is required to provide all equipment, arms, and armor for the retainer. The pay the retainer receives is for them to spend as they see fit, and as such the PC has no control over it. Do not bother tracking the retainer's coin, as it is assumed they will spend it on their own. It is important to remember that while retainers will usually follow the player's orders and the player will roll the dice for them, retainers are still NPCs and therefore under the arbiter's control. The arbiter will decide how the retainer reacts to situations, and will roleplay them as they see fit.

Retainers follow the same advancement rules as PCs.

To create a retainer roll a 3d6 to determine each attribute, give them 1d6 stamina and a d6 damage weapon. A retainer has 10 inventory slots. Experienced retainers might possess spells and higher attributes at the arbiter’s discretion. Retainers should have a background and talents that are applicable - they do not need to be the same ones as listed in the backgrounds section, but can be rolled on that list for ease of use. The arbiter may have a pool of pre-existing retainers to choose from, or you can roll up your own using the customization rules from the character creation section if the arbiter allows it.

Each PC can hire a maximum number of retainers based on their WIL score, which is shown in the table below. Retainers also have a loyalty rating which is also determined by the PC's WIL score.
### Retainer Loyalty and Max Amount
A retainer's loyalty rating is determined by the PC's WIL score. This rating can be adjusted at the arbiter's discretion:
- ****Bonuses:**** A retainer's loyalty can increased if the PC treats them well, or if they are paid more than the standard rate of a half share.
- ****Penalties:**** A retainer's loyalty can be decreased if the PC treats them poorly, or has gone against their word.

| PC WIL Score | Retainer Loyalty | Max # |
| :----------: | :--------------: | :---: |
|      3       |        4         |   1   |
|     4-5      |        5         |   2   |
|     6-8      |        6         |   3   |
|     9-12     |        7         |   4   |
|    13-15     |        8         |   5   |
|    16-17     |        9         |   6   |
|      18      |        10        |   7   |

### Loyalty Checks
A loyalty check is made when a retainer is asked to do something that they would not normally do, or if they are treated poorly. The arbiter can also call for a loyalty check if they feel it is necessary. A loyalty check is made by rolling 2d6 and comparing the result to the retainer's loyalty rating. If the result is equal to or less than the loyalty rating, the retainer will do as asked. If the result is higher than the loyalty rating, the retainer will refuse to do as asked, and may leave the PC's service.

If a retainer ever obtains a loyalty rating of 12, they will no longer question the PC's orders, and will follow them without question. If a retainer ever obtains a loyalty rating of 3 or lower, they will refuse to follow the PC's orders, and will leave their service. Depending on the circumstances, the retainer may also become hostile to the PC, and will certainly inform others of the PC's actions.
### Heirs
A PC may choose to specify one of their retainers as their heir. This provides some benefits:
- If the PC dies, the heir will inherit all of their possessions and immediately take their place in the party. Without an heir, the PC's possessions are split between the entire party.
- The heir will save 10% of the pay they receive, and will bank it for the player's use if the PC dies. 

In order to gain this benefit, the heir must be paid a full share instead of a half share. For example, a party of 4 PCs and 2 retainers finds a large amount of treasure worth 50,000p and a full share is worth 10,000p. Normally the PCs would gain 10,000p each, and the retainers would gain 5,000p each. If two PCs have an heir, they would all gain 8,333p instead as they all receive a full share. The players with an heir then adds 833p to their heir's sheet for potential future gain. If the PC then spent all of their coin the night before and dies the next day, the player would have all of their old PC's possessions, and 833p extra. This banked coin will build up over time, and will become a nest egg for the player if their PC dies. 
### Shares of Treasure
Fractional shares of treasure are calculated by dividing the total amount of treasure by the number of shares. A group of 4 PCs (which each get a full share) and 3 retainers (which each get a half share) would divide the treasure by 5.5. If the party found 2,200p worth of treasure, each PC would get 400p and each retainer would get 200p.
## Mercenaries
Mercenaries are hired soldiers who will form detachments, go to battle, and serve in expeditions. If brought into dungeons or any situation where fighting is planned, they will charge double the normal rate as battle wages. A PC or retainer can take the role of any officer in a detachment. There is no limit on the number of mercenaries a PC may employ.
- 5 mercenaries make a ***lance***.
- 25 mercenaries make a ***contingent***; in addition, there must be a ***corporal***.
- 100 mercenaries make a ***company***; in addition, there must be a ***captain*** and four ***corporals***.
- A ***general*** leads two or more ***companies***.
- ***Battle prices are double*** the normal rate listed.
- A dedicated ***armorer*** is required per 50 troops.
- Mercenaries usually have weapons and armor already when hired. Their employer can provide additional gear.
- Their wages cover upkeep costs.
- When properly stationed in a settlement, institution, estate, or domain - any of which must be owned by the PC employing them - mercenaries cost half as much as normal. This is because their upkeep is covered by the settlement, institution, estate, or domain.

## Specialists
Specialists do not go on adventures, instead remaining in a settlement and performing specific functions. There is no limit on the number of specialists a character may employ. Specialists are listed in order of rarity, in order to facilitate random determination when necessary.
1. ***Laborer***: Perform manual labor, such as building structures, harvesting resources, clearing obstructions, etc. One laborer is required per 250p cost of the project.
2. ***Bard***: Can spread rumors, potentially making it easier to hire retainers or counteract the negative effects of treating retainers poorly.
3. ***Sailor***: Needed to crew marine vessels for sailing. Each crew needs a ***captain***. Any time a ship ventures beyond sight of a coastline, it becomes lost if a ***navigator*** is not aboard.
4. ***Surveyor***: Needed to survey an area during expeditions.
5. ***Animal Handler***: Can train animals.
6. ***Armorer***: Maintains mercenaries’ gear. A dedicated armorer is required per 50 troops. 200 mercenaries’ gear maintained if 3 assistants are hired, and 400 mercenaries’ gear maintained if 6 assistants are hired. An armorer cannot manage more than 6 assistants.
7. ***Assistant Armorer***: Apprentices who work under an ***armorer***. They increase the rate of production for an armorer.
8. ***Craftsman***: Can craft items based on their profession.
9. ***Advocate***: Necessary to bring a legal trial to action or to mount a defence. Each additional advocate adds +1 to the roll, to a max of 3.
10. ***Physician***: Can treat one disease or serious wound per week.
11. ***Scholar***: Can conduct investigations. Each additional scholar that is engaged to investigate the same topic  adds +1 to the roll for investigation attempts, to a max of +3.
12. ***Spy***: Allows for the target on whom they are spying to become a source for investigations. Each additional spy that is engaged to spy on the same target adds +1 to the roll for investigation attempts, to a max of +3.
13. ***Engineer***: Plan and oversee large construction projects such as domain building. One engineer is required per 50,000p cost of the project.
14. ***Alchemist***: Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost. An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.
15. ***Sage***: Sages are very rare individuals who devote their lives to the study of obscure knowledge. A sage may be consulted to answer unusual questions. The referee must judge the time and cost required to research the answer to a question. There is never a 100% chance of success in finding an answer.
16. ***Assassin***: Individuals trained in the art of death. Their price will depend on the job - who the target is, preferred method of death, and many more factors.
