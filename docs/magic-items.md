# Magical Items
Items with magical properties are rarely found in shops. The most common way of acquiring magical items is through adventuring and searching for them in places few others dare to go.
## Identifying Magical Items
A PC can feel when an item is magical but the properties of the item can only be discovered by using it, through careful experimentation, or paying an NPC mage or priest to identify it.
## Magical Weapons & Armor
Enchanted weapons and armor grant the wearer a bonus ranging from +1 to +3 or some other magical effect.
- When wielding a magic weapon the bonus is applied to the damage of the weapon.
- When wearing magic armor the bonus is applied to the AV of the armor piece. This can bring the normal humanoid max AV above 4 to a max of 6.

## Scrolls
A scroll is a spell infused in a piece of parchment and is destroyed after a single use. They are recovered from places like tombs, dungeons, manors, and can be copied permanently into a Grimoire.

A PC can create a scroll of a spell they know by spending ***1m*** and taking a ***Watch*** to create it.
