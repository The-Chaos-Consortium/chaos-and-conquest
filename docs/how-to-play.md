# How to Play
An arbiter controls and describes the world to players who then describe how their characters (PCs) act in the world. All entities controlled by the arbiter are known as non-player characters (NPCs).
## Player's Role
### Character
You are not defined by your character sheet or abilities. They are just some of your available tools - be creative. Do not only think from the perspective of your character, instead ask yourself what you would do.
### Exploration
Asking questions and paying attention to detail is more useful than anything on your character sheet. 

Exploration is a crucial aspect of navigating perilous environments, and the most valuable asset at your disposal is the ability to ask questions. Mastering this skill is the linchpin for survival and unearthing hidden treasures.

When the arbiter unveils details, it's a safe assumption that there's more valuable information to be uncovered. Pose targeted questions to extract the necessary details and guide yourself toward success.

Eventually, you'll encounter a barrier obstructing your path to the coveted treasure.
### Communication
If feasible, taking your way through problems is typically the safest approach. Utilize dialogue as a tool to extract information from NPCs, understand mutual assistance opportunities, and potentially identify vulnerabilities in case situations take a turn for the worse.
### Stealth
If diplomacy falls short, opting for stealth or alternative methods to bypass obstacles becomes a prudent secondary strategy. This may involve diverting attention, pilfering a key, or revisiting the challenge later. With careful planning, drawing your sword might not even be necessary.
### Combat
Combat is always a choice, and should generally be your last choice. One lucky blow can end your life, and even if you survive, you will likely be wounded and scarred. If you must fight, do so with a plan. Use the environment to your advantage, and try to avoid fighting on your opponent’s terms. If you can’t avoid a fight, try to make it as quick and decisive as possible. If the tides turn and it's not looking good for you, don't be afraid to run away.
### Risk vs. Reward
There are many more treasures and rewards out in the world, so if you find yourself in a situation where the risk outweighs the reward, it's best to cut your losses and move on. You can always come back later when you're better prepared, or try a completely different approach.
## Arbiter's Role
### Neutrality
The arbiter is a neutral judge. They are neither *on* the player's side *nor* against them. They are there to accurately describe the world and its inhabitants, and to adjudicate the rules. They are not there to tell a story, or to win. They are there to facilitate the game and to make sure everyone has fun. The arbiter should make sure to apply the rules equally to PCs, NPCs, and the world itself.
### Arbiter of Rules
The games rules cannot possibly cover every situation that may arise. When a situation arises that is not covered by the rules, the arbiter should make a ruling based on what makes sense in the context of the game world. If the arbiter is unsure of what to do, they should make a ruling that is in the best interest of the game and the players. If the arbiter makes a ruling that is later found to be incorrect, they should make a note of it and correct it in the future. When the arbiter thinks random chance is appropriate, they may ask the PCs to make a relevant save, or roll a d6 themselves for an x-in-6 chance of success. Regardless of how the arbiter decides to handle the situation, always make sure to tell the PCs the chances, and let them decide whether or not to take the risk.
## Saves
When the PC is doing something *risky* where *success* of an action is *uncertain*, a player rolls a d20. If you roll *equal to* or *under* the relevant attribute score, you succeed and suffer no consequences. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

The arbiter can also ask a player to make a save to determine if a PC is able to resist an effect or react quickly enough to avoid harm.
### Opposed Saves
Sometimes a PC’s action is counteracted or resisted by an NPC. In that case, both sides make a save (NPCs use their Skill score). The side with the *highest successful roll* wins and succeeds at what they are trying to attempt. If both sides fail the save, the situation gets worse and more complicated for both of them. In the case of a tie, the arbiter decides the outcome.
### Party Saves
Whenever the success of the entire party influences the outcome of a situation, a party save will be used. A common example of this is when the party attempts to sneak around as a group. To attempt a party save one PC must be chosen to lead the action. Then, each participating PC makes an appropriate save, with the best result among them counting as the result for the whole group. For each PC who failed their roll, the action leader takes stress as they push themselves to cover for the failures of the party members who don’t succeed.
### Advantage & Disadvantage
Some situations can give a PC situational *advantage* on a save. When you have *advantage* you roll two d20s and keep the *best result*. If you are at a *disadvantage*, roll two d20s and keep the *worst result*. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa.

Relevant equipment can also give *advantage* on a save (e.g. using a crowbar to open a stuck door). 
## Talents
Talents are the areas of expertise of a character. They grant *advantage* on relevant saves. If a PC is also carrying relevant equipment the arbiter may rule that the save automatically succeeds (e.g. they have the “Lock-picking” talent and are using lock-picks). Talents can also unlock certain abilities e.g. Armor Master, or allow a PC to just do a certain action.
## Inventory & Stress
A PC has a number of *inventory slots* equal to their *STR or 10, whichever is higher*. Most items take one slot to carry but some items, like weapons or armor, take up multiple slots.

Some actions and situations, like pushing the PC (see below), cause a PC to receive *stress*. Each instance of stress takes up an inventory slot.

A PC cannot carry more items or stress than they have inventory slots. If all of your inventory slots are filled with stress, you *die*. If you are forced to take stress when your inventory is full and you are unable to drop something, take d6 damage for each stress not added to your inventory.

Spending a week resting in a safe location removes all stress.
## Pushing a Character
Before making a save, if their character has at least one empty inventory slot, players may choose to push their character to *receive advantage* on the roll. If they do so, the PC *takes stress*. This source of advantage can take the place of a missing Talent - but not equipment - for a potential automatic success.

NPCs cannot push themselves.
## Combat
Combat is played in *rounds*. Each round:
1. *Establish combat order*. Roll a d6 for each side to determine the combat order this round; the side that rolls highest goes first. In case of a tie, both sides act simultaneously. This can lead to enemies and PCs both dying at the end of the round once all attacks and actions have resolved.
1. *Each side acts*. When a character can act they may move around and take an action. This action may be attacking, casting a spell, making a second move or any other action deemed reasonable by the arbiter. Each character should declare their actions and enact them simultaneously. This means when multiple people are attacking the same target, they all roll their damage at the same time.

### Attacks
*Attacks always hit*. Roll your weapon’s die and do that much damage to an opponent *minus their Armor Value (AV)*. Ranged weapons cannot be used in melee.

Attacks that are *impaired*, such as firing through cover or fighting while grappled, roll damage twice and deal the *lowest result*.

Similarly, attacks that are enhanced by a risky stunt or a helpless or vulnerable target roll a *bonus damage die*. This is represented as +d6, +d8, etc. and is added to the normal damage dealt. Attacks against a completely helpless target always receive +d12. In other situations the arbiter will decide which die type to grant.
- E.g. a bandit is being held down by two allies. The PC attacks with a longsword (d10) and is granted a +d12 bonus for the bandit being helpless. The PC rolls a 4 and a 7, for a total of 11 damage dealt.

### Blast Damage
Attacks suitably large enough to affect all targets in the appropriate area. Damage is rolled separately for each target. If there is any doubt as to how many targets can be affected, roll the attack’s die.
### Critical Hits
Rolling *maximum damage* on a weapon’s damage dice is a *critical hit*. It bypasses all armor, and *decreases the target’s AV by 1*. This decrease happens at the end of the round.

Any bonus damage dice do not count towards a critical hit check - only the original damage dice do, e.g. attacking with a longsword (d10) +d8 bonus die, the PC rolls a 10 on the d10 and a 2 on the +d8. This counts as a critical hit.
### Dual Wielding
If dual-wielding a set of weapons, roll damage for both and choose which result to keep.
### Mounted Combat
When mounted a PC gains a bonus damage die equal to their base weapon damage when in melee combat against a foe smaller than them. A flail wielding PC will do 2d8 total damage in melee. If a magic weapon does more than the standard d6 - d10 damage, the bonus damage die is equal to the damage of a basic similar weapon.

A horse or similar mount is required to have this benefit.
### Worn Weapons
*Roll a d6 at the end of combat* in which the PC used a weapon. On a *result of 1*, their weapon becomes *worn*. A worn weapon has its damage reduced to 1 until it is repaired. A worn weapon cannot do a critical hit.

A worn weapon is repaired after a full week of rest, or by spending *Supply* (see [Equipment](equipment.md#supply)).
### Morale
NPCs have a *Morale* score. The arbiter should make a Morale roll when something manages to shock the NPCs (they meet more resistance than expected, their leader is killed etc.).

To make a morale roll, *roll 2d6*. If the result is higher than the Morale of the NPCs, they will flee or attempt to parley.
### Movement
Movement in combat is handled using abstract zones. At the start of combat the arbiter will divide the battlefield into zones. The number and size of zones will vary, but a zone is roughly 30 feet squared, and there should be at least three zones (one where PCs start, one where enemies start, and a zone between them). Over combat the number of zones can change.

Movement within a zone is free - there are no restrictions on singular zone movement. Moving to an adjoining zone will use your movement; you may spend your action to move to a second zone. Creatures that share a zone can engage in melee combat, or any other physical interaction. As long as a creature has not yet been engaged in melee combat they are free to make ranged attacks.
### Disengage
If a PC wishes to move away when engaged in a melee with one or more enemies they must make a successful *DEX* save. If the save is failed, you must choose to either be stuck in melee and lose your movement, or the enemy is granted a free attack before your movement. If an ally is also engaged in the same melee, or an action is used to move away carefully, no *DEX* save is required.
### Retreat
Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful *DEX* save, as well as a safe destination to run to.
### Damage & Armor
If a creature takes damage while they’re wearing armor, the damage is *reduced* by their *Armor Value (AV)*. Any damage above the AV reduces stamina. Humanoids can have a *max of 4 AV* normally - with magic items this can go up to 6 AV.

Some attacks or effects may deal damage directly and ignore a creature’s armor.
### Shields
Wielding a shield allows you to sunder it, breaking it beyond repair, in order to block all damage from *one* incoming attack. It must make sense for the shield to be able to block the incoming damage, e.g. a melee or ranged attack, not fall damage. A PC may carry a max of 1 spare shield on their person, assuming they are currently holding one.
## Stamina & Death
Stamina is a measure of your ability to avoid life-threatening harm. Each time a creature takes *damage* they subtract the number from their *stamina*. When a non-retainer NPC reaches 0 or less stamina they have taken a fatal blow and are dead.

If a PC’s or retainer's stamina becomes 0 or lower, they are bleeding out and on Death’s door and must roll a d6. On a 1-3, they die. On a 4 or above, they fall unconscious and are dying. The dying character must have their wounds treated by another character with a WIL save or magic within a turn, or they die. If a dying PC receives any damage, they die.

If they survive, they wake up with 1 stamina and roll on the scars table.

## Rest & Healing
*Short Rest*: A PC may spend a turn catching their breath to spend a single supply to repair a weapon or armor.

*Night’s Rest*: After consuming a ration and a full night’s rest of two watches, PCs regain d8 lost stamina and remove 1 Stress. PCs may also spend any number of supplies to repair weapons and armor.

*Full Rest*: Spending a full week resting in a safe location regains all stamina, restores any lowered attributes, removes all stress, repairs armor, and restores worn weapons.
## Distance
Measuring distance is handled abstractly, making it faster and easier.

<p style="text-align: center;">Close - You can touch it. This is the current zone you are in.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nearby - You can get to it. This is any adjacent zone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Far Away - You can shoot it. This is usually up to three zones away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Distant - You can see it. Four or more zones away.</p>

## Time
Time is tracked using three measurements:
- *Round - 20 seconds* in-game, used during combat. A round is enough time for a PC to move nearby and perform an action like casting a spell or attacking, as described earlier in this chapter.
- *Turn - 10 minutes* in-game, used while exploring an adventuring site. A turn is enough time for a party of PCs to search a dungeon room, pick a lock or do any other significant activity. Once every two turns, the arbiter rolls a d6. On a result of 1, an encounter occurs and the arbiter rolls on a random encounter table (either one they prepared themselves or that is included in the adventure they’re using) to determine the nature of the encounter.
- *Watch - 4 hours* in-game, used when traveling the overworld. A watch is enough time for a party to travel about 6 miles (1 hex), hunt for food, or explore the area around them. Once every two watches, the arbiter rolls a d6 to determine if a random encounter occurs, as above. The 6 watches in a day are as follows:
  - Night, 12am - 4am
  - Dawn, 4am - 8am
  - Day, 8am - 12pm
  - Day, 12pm - 4pm
  - Dusk, 4pm - 8pm
  - Night, 8pm - 12am

## Overland Travel
For each Watch, the party takes one action.
### Travel
The party can travel one hex or 6 miles per Watch. Difficult terrain (rivers, mountains, desert, jungle, etc.) requires two Watches per hex traveled.

There is a 2-in-6 chance the party will get lost when traveling via difficult or hard-to-see terrain. Maps and relevant backgrounds negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances to 1-in-6.
### Explore
The party searches for any hidden features within the current hex. Each time a hex is explored there is a 2-in-6 chance of finding a hidden feature. This action can be repeated up to three times in each hex. All results are final, meaning some hexes may just be empty.

If the arbiter has any planned features located in the hex, the arbiter should reveal them after a watch spent exploring.
### Forage
The party gathers food and water if possible given the terrain, and finds d4 rations. If there is a Pathfinder in the party, find d6 rations. For parties of more than 6 PCs and/or retainers, you may roll an extra die for each group of 6 - e.g. a party of size 7-12 would roll 2d4/2d6, a party of 13-18 would roll 3d4/3d6, etc.
### Camp
The party stops to set up camp. Must do this for two consecutive watches every six watches. A party must sleep for at least 8 hours, or 2 watches, a night. If a character’s sleep is interrupted by combat or other excitement, they do not recover stamina that night. Taking a shift on watch does not interrupt this rest, unless something happens during their watch or they use their watch to explore.
### Interact
The party interacts with a location/feature. Dungeon delving, town/village adventure, lair exploration, long NPC interaction, etc…
### Fatigue
For each night the party skips making camp, each PC gains *stress*. A party can travel or explore for three watches a day without getting fatigued. Each watch past three spent traveling or exploring results in a *stress*.
## Advancement
A PC increases in Level by gaining XP, as shown in the table below.

| Level | XP Needed |
| :---: | :-------: |
|   1   |     0     |
|   2   |   2,000   |
|   3   |   4,000   |
|   4   |   8,000   |
|   5   |  16,000   |
|   6   |  32,000   |
|   7   |  64,000   |
|   8   |  125,000  |
|   9   |  250,000  |
|  10   |  500,000  |
|  11+  | +250,000  |

When a PC’s Level increases they:
- From Level 1 to 10, pick one attribute to increase by 1. No attribute score can be increased above 18.
- From Level 1 to 10, roll a number of d8s equal to your new level. If the rolled sum is greater than your current stamina max, take it as your new max. Otherwise, increase your max by 1. From Level 11 onwards you no longer roll, and instead gain 2 stamina per Level.
  - E.g. Level 1 stamina is 3. Upon reaching Level 2, roll 2d8, and the sum is 7, which is now your new max stamina.
  - E.g. Level 10 stamina is 40. Upon reaching Level 11, add 2 stamina for a new max stamina of 42.

Talents are not earned by gaining Levels; they must be hunted for. This can be done via downtime turns or any other way the arbiter decides. 
### Rewarding XP
At the end of each session the arbiter rewards each character XP based on their share of the value of the non-magical treasure they brought back safely from adventures (1p = 1 XP). This is specifically for treasure found or payments received due to completing dangerous tasks. Trading profits do not count, nor does robbing citizens. Unless stated otherwise in the downtime turns section, PCs do not gain XP for income made in downtime turns. Mundane equipment does not count as treasure if looted from a defeated foe or found in a dungeon. The characters never gain XP for fighting or killing - no matter how dangerous the foe. Treasure is the only way.

A PC also gains 1 XP per 1p of treasure they waste. This must be done immediately after returning to town from an adventure. Income from ventures other than adventuring cannot be wasted for XP.

Wasting is any monetary transaction which is not: an investment, something which will give a return on value, either financially or through use, or a necessity. A meal, for example, is not waste, but a lavish banquet is. Gilding your armor or weapons is waste, buying a fancy set of clothes, donating to an instituion annonymously, or buying a round of drinks are all examples of waste. Use this opportuniuty to flesh out your character and their personality based on how they throw their money around.
