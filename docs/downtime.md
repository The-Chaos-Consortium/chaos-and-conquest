# Downtime Turns
## Downtime Turn Actions
During ***Downtime Turns*** the PCs specify which actions they are taking in the period of time between adventures, in addition to regular activities. A Downtime Turn usually takes ***1 month*** of time in-game, but this amount of time can vary depending on the circumstances or task. Depending on the activity a PC may be taken out of play while the activity is happening, e.g. learning a talent requires complete devotion and the PC cannot be played during this time. Other activities can be handled by a trusted retainer instead of the PC themself.

Most activities that require progress to be tracked in some way during Downtime Turns use the following procedure.

First, set a tracker for the number of successes an activity requires.

Use the following as a rubric for the number of successes required on a tracker for an activity to be successful:
- 1 - Minor Advantage
- 3 - Significant Advantage
- 5 - Campaign Defining Goal
- 7 - Major Campaign Defining Goal

A PC may use their action during downtime turns to attempt to make progress on this activity. Note that they must describe an adequate method of accomplishing this activity. If the PC  does not have the necessary resources required to engage in such an activity, whether it be money or some other such resource (for example, if attempting to set up a drug trade, they would need prior access to a reliable source of drugs), they cannot attempt the action.

When a PC attempts to make progress on an activity during downtime turns, they roll 2d6, plus any appropriate situational modifiers, whether they be positive (expenditure of extra resources, clever method or approach, character skill) or negative (unreliable resources or otherwise poor fictional positioning). Situational modifiers should not exceed in total +/-3.
- A roll of 10+ means that the PC is successful in their activity, and may mark one success on the tracker.
- A roll of 7-9 indicates that either a complication or setback has occurred, which must be dealt with before further progress can be made, or that partial progress has been made; in the case of partial progress, a success is not marked on the tracker, but the next time the PC attempts this activity, it will automatically succeed.
- A roll of 6 or lower indicates that the PC was unsuccessful in their endeavor, and no progress is made.

## Setbacks
A setback indicates that some complication has arisen which is stymieing a PC’s progress on their goal or renders a PC’s asset unusable. For example, if a PC's estate is suffering a setback, some problem is rendering it uninhabitable till dealt with.

When a PC’s estate, institution, infrastructure project, or domain suffers a setback, they gain xp equal to its current base investment cost (e.g. if a PC is attempting to advance their tier 3 institution to tier 4 and they suffer a setback, they gain xp equal to the base investment cost of a tier 3 institution: 2,500); if multiple PCs are invested, they divide the xp equally amongst themselves.

A setback can be cleared by dealing with it directly in play.

A setback may also be dealt with by spending a downtime turn action. It is up to the arbiter’s discretion depending on the specific nature of the setback whether simply taking the action will suffice to deal with it, if a save is required, or whether expenditures of resources are necessary; a arbiter may also rule that due to the nature of the setback, it cannot be dealt with abstractly through a downtime turn action and must be handled by the PC directly.

As a general procedure, if an institution, infrastructure project, or domain suffers a setback, it can be cleared with a downtime turn action and paying half the current base investment cost.
## Improving Attributes
PCs can spend their downtime turns working to improve one of their attributes - ***this takes one month per attempt***. To do so they roll 3d6, and if the result is higher than the attribute they are trying to improve, the attribute increases by 1. No attribute can be higher than 18.

This initially costs ***500p***, representing the cost of acquiring adequate trainers and material, ***but doubles after each attempt***, regardless of which attribute is being worked on.
## Learning a Talent
PCs can spend their downtime turns to acquire a new talent. A tracker should be set depending on how narrowly defined the talent is:
- Narrow Talent - 2 Successes (e.g. Foraging, Spelunking, House Blackmane History)
- Broad Talent - 4 Successes (e.g. Armor Master, Survival, Alchemy)

To be able to learn a talent, the PC must have access to the proper resources needed to learn it. For example, a character cannot learn the Swimming talent without access to a body of water.

| 2d6 | Result                                                                       |
| :-: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 10+ | Progress is made towards the new talent.                                     |
| 7-9 | Partial progress has been made. The next attempt will automatically succeed. |
| 2-6 | No progress has been made.                                                   |

## Adding a spell to a spellbook
PCs can spend their downtime turns to add a spell to an existing spellbook. A tracker should be set for one success, and the cost paid as mentioned in [Spell Creation](magic-spellcasting.md#spell-creation). The cost is only paid on the first attempt, and any successive attempts do not require payment.

Roll 2d6. Each spellcaster apprentice (up to a maximum of 3) adds +1 to the roll, and having a proper workshop (wizard's tower, witch's den, alchemist's lab, etc.) adds +1 to the roll.

| 2d6 |                                                     Result                                                     |
| :-: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 10+ |                                        New spell is added to spellbook.                                        |
| 7-9 | The process requires some sort of new material, offering, or completion of a task, before it can be continued. |
| 2-6 |                                           No progress has been made.                                           |

## Expeditions
An expedition is used to extract resources from or settle an area.

Mounting an expedition can be performed as an action during a downtime turn.

Before an expedition can be mounted, the area must be cleared, whether this is emptying all of the monster lairs within a hex, negotiating a treaty with the inhabitants of that area, or obtaining title from a ruler to settle lands.

Once the area has been cleared, an expedition can be sent to secure it via patrols. Attempting to secure one area, whether that is a hex or a dungeon level, takes one downtime turn.

Mounting an expedition to secure an area requires at least one mercenary lance to be deployed.

Once an expedition has been deployed, roll 2d6. Each additional mercenary lance deployed adds +1 to the roll, up to a maximum of +3 for fielding three lances.

| 2d6 | Result                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 10+ | The area is secured.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7-9 | The expedition runs into a complication that must be dealt with before the area can be secured, such as encountering a monster lair, dispute with the locals, or supply route collapse. |
| 2-6 | The expedition fails to secure the area.                                                                                                                                                |

When securing an area, mercenaries are paid battle wages. In addition, each lance needs 50 supplies a month, as well as a reliable supply route to transport said provisions.

Supplies cost 3 shillings for 3 day's worth of food, water, and other sundries.

Once an area is secured, mercenaries can set up and hold a base camp.

While holding a base camp, mercenaries are paid regular wages, and only need 25 supplies per lance a month. A base camp can be held for six downtime turns, after which the mercenaries will begin making morale rolls each downtime turn to determine if they continue to hold the area.

Once a base camp has been established, the area can be surveyed, which requires a surveyor. Surveying an area takes one downtime turn and will reveal all the resources in an area, as well as any hidden features.

Once an area has been surveyed, labor efforts such as extracting resources or building estates can occur, so long as the base camp continues to hold.

One laborer can extract 50s of value of resources per downtime turn. They can construct buildings at the normal rate. A hex can support 3d3 laborers at a time, which represents the amount of resources available in the area.

Each surveyor, laborer, architect, and other retainers in a base camp need 6 supplies a month.
## Estates
To build personal estates, the PC must acquire the land (via expedition or some other means), hire laborers, and pay for the construction of any buildings. One laborer is needed for every 250p of construction.

Construction time is determined by the costs of construction. Each day 500p of value can be constructed. An architect is needed for every 50,000p of construction, and the overall construction speed can be cut in half if the PC pays double the construction cost.

One laborer, therefore, could build a hovel (120p) in a day. Building a row house (1,200p) however, would require five laborers and take three days.

Each building comes with furnishings of appropriate value relative to the structure. If the PC wishes to improve the standard of construction and furnishings, they may pay double the cost of the building.

They may do this as many times as they wish, each time doubling the cost further.

The basic level of furnishing for a hovel, for example, would barely be furnished apart from the bare essentials, and those would be of a poor standard. The basic level of furnishing for a merchant's house would be quite comfortable, and for an imperial palace would be incredibly luxurious. A PC could pay double the cost of the palace, 5,000,000 pennies, to improve it, or pay double that value, 10,000,000, to improve it even further.

If the PC wants to add anything into the structure that requires special craftsmanship, such as traps, secret doors or passageways, ornate decorations, etc. it adds 1,000 pennies to the cost of the structure per specific object.

Building special rooms, such as a library, laboratory, or shrine, each costs 5% of the base cost of the building, and are of a standard of appropriate value relative to the structure (e.g. a library in a merchant’s house is rather basic, whereas one in an imperial palace would be a famed repository of knowledge).
## Infrastructure
PCs can found settlements or increase the size of existing settlements by making investments into infrastructure.

To found a hamlet, the area it is to be built in must be secured and surveyed, and an estate of at least 2,000p in value built, around which the hamlet can be organized.

Founding a hamlet requires it to be constructed using the same process as constructing an estate. The cost of construction for a hamlet is 5,000p.

To change the settlement type of an existing settlement, no laborers are required. However, the settlement in question must have a route, either by land, water, or some other method, between it and a given number of other settlements.

A tracker is set for the number of successes needed to advance a settlement to the next tier. The number of successes is equal to the tier being advanced to (e.g. expanding a hamlet to a village requires two successes).

Attempting to improve infrastructure can be performed as an action during a downtime turn. To do so, a PC pays the base investment cost for the settlement type they are attempting to advance to and rolls 2d6, with bonuses applying for extra expenditures and established institutions within the settlement. These bonuses cannot cumulatively exceed +3.

A PC only needs to pay the base investment cost (plus any bonus expenditures) during the first attempt they make. Successive attempts do not require payment.

| 2d6 |                                                                                                                                                    Result                                                                                                                                                     |
| :-: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 10+ |                                                                                                                                      Success is marked on the tracker.                                                                                                                                       |
| 7-9 | A setback occurs, which prevents further infrastructure progress until it is dealt with. This may be that the settlement may not have adequate resources, such as food or water, to expand, or the settlement's expansion infringes on settled territory, or the lair of a monster or a dungeon is uncovered. |
| 2-6 |                                                                                                                                             No progress is made.                                                                                                                                              |

|   2 (village)   |       20,000p        |  +1 for each additional 5,000p spent. +1 for each tier 1 institution owned by the company in the settlement  |                Must be connected to 2 hamlets                |
|    3 (town)     |       80,000p        | +1 for each additional 20,000p spent. +1 for each tier 2 institution owned by the company in the settlement  |               Must be connected to 2 villages                |
|    4 (city)     |       320,000p       | +1 for each additional 80,000p spent. +1 for each tier 4 institution owned by the company in the settlement  |                 Must be connected to 2 towns                 |
| 5 (metropolis)  |      1,280,000p      | +1 for each additional 320,000p spent. +1 for each tier 6 institution owned by the company in the settlement |                Must be connected to 2 cities                 |

## Institutions
An institution is any kind of organization or long term enterprise. Examples would include a bar, teahouse, shop, theater troupe, garrison, mercenary outfit, gang, guild, orphanage, and so on.

Institutions offer specific benefits to the characters who have invested in them. These are customized for each given institution. For example, investing in a stagecoach network might allow for more retainers to be available for hire, and for retainers of higher levels to appear in that settlement. Institutions also provide monthly profit based on their tier. This profit is considerably lower than what it would be if the PC worked full time for the institution; As PCs are primarily adventurers, they will profit roughly a 20-25%  return on investment annually.

Institutions can be categorized into seven different tiers. To found a tier 1 institution, a PC must have some kind of resource available that would allow them to begin operations. For example, if they wish to found a cult, they should already have a few followers committed to the cause. As an action during a downtime turn, they can then spend 500p to establish that institution in the settlement they are in.

PCs can also invest, partner in, or assume ownership of pre-existing institutions. Purchasing an already established institution will normally cost 10x the base investment cost.

To advance an institution up a tier, if the prerequisites for settlement type are met, a PC must describe their method for growing the institution. They then pay the base investment cost of the tier to which they are attempting to advance the institution, and roll 2d6, with bonuses applying for extra expenditures, to a max of +3.

| 2d6 |                                                              Result                                                              |
| :-: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 10+ |                                              Institution advances to the next tier.                                              |
| 7-9 | A setback occurs, which prevents further growth until it is dealt with; no benefits can be received until setback is dealt with. |
| 2-6 |                                                       No progress is made.                                                       |

The base investment costs for each institution tier are listed below, as well as any prerequisites.

| Institution Tier | Base Investment Cost |               Bonuses                |             Prerequisites              | Monthly Profit |
| :--------------: | :------------------: | :----------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: | :------------: |

|        2         |        1,000p        |  +1 for each additional 500p spent   | Must be located in a village or larger |      20p       |
|        3         |        2,500p        | +1 for each additional 1,250p spent  | Must be located in a village or larger |      45p       |
|        4         |        5,000p        | +1 for each additional 2,500p spent  |  Must be located in a town or larger   |      90p       |
|        5         |       10,000p        | +1 for each additional 5,000p spent  |  Must be located in a town or larger   |      200p      |
|        6         |       20,000p        | +1 for each additional 10,000p spent |  Must be located in a city or larger   |      400p      |
|        7         |       40,000p        | +1 for each additional 20,000p spent |    Must be located in a metropolis     |      800p      |

To relocate an institution to another settlement, treat it the same as attempting to advance the institution a tier. If the roll is successful, the institution is now headquartered in the new location. The PC and arbiter can determine if it has relocated entirely, or left some auxiliary or franchise branch behind in the old settlement.	

If the institution suffers a setback, the arbiter may roll on the following table for inspiration.

| 2d6 |            Setback            |
| :-: | :---------------------------: |

## Domains
Having accrued enough power, some rarefied few worthy individuals may find themselves rulers of a domain.

This domain functions as any other polity in the game world, except for the important detail that the characters have direct control of it at the macro-level, being able to set the code of laws, appoint NPCs to positions of power, and more.

Domains can be categorised into 10 tiers. A tier 1 domain is immediately founded once a character has founded a hamlet. 

This is the ***demesne***, or ***personal domain***, of the character - meaning the lands they directly control. The hex ranges defined in the benefit section reference this personal domain, not the max size of the entire realm the character rules over. A character can only have one personal domain, and must rely on vassals to rule over other domains. A ruler can subinfeudate their realm to vassals, who can then subinfeudate their own domains to vassals, and so on. This nested hierarchy of vassals is known as ***feudalism***. There are no defined rules for how many vassals a ruler can have - but the ruler must be able to effectively rule over their realm, and if they have too many vassals, they may find themselves unable to do so, or find that their vassals are too powerful and can challenge them.

Once a domain has been founded, it can be improved by investing money into it, so long as certain prerequisites are met.

A tracker is set for the number of successes needed to advance a domain to the next tier. The number of successes is equal to the tier being advanced to (e.g. expanding a tier 2 domain to a tier 3 domain requires three successes).

A character can attempt to improve a domain as an action during a downtime turn. To do so, a character pays the base investment cost for the domain tier they are attempting to advance to and rolls 2d6, with bonuses applying for extra expenditures. These bonuses cannot cumulatively exceed +3.

A character only needs to pay the base investment cost (plus any bonus expenditures) during the first attempt they make. Successive attempts do not require payment.

Mundane items & services refers to the chance that the domain can furnish specific goods and services. Basic goods & services, like food or simple blacksmithing, can be assumed since these are necessities, but specialty items such as, say, siege weaponry or spices will require a roll.

If the roll is successful, the domain will always be able to provide that item or service. If the roll is unsuccessful, then that item or service cannot be obtained until either the direct action is taken to make it available (e.g. by recruiting a skilled engineer, or establishing a trading route for spices), or until the domain increases in tier, whereupon it may be tested for again.

Domain armies are made up of citizens who will take up arms to protect their home, not career soldiers. They can be kept out in the field for a number of months equal to the domain’s tier plus two.
### Vassals & Titles
A vassal is a person who has sworn fealty to a ruler, and in return is granted a fiefdom, or domain, to rule over. The vassal is expected to provide military service to their lord, and in return the lord is expected to provide protection and justice to their vassal.

This process involves the ceremonies of homage and fealty, in which the vassal swears an oath of loyalty to their lord during which they become "their man". Generally speaking the vassal does not pay any monetary taxes, but is required to provide military service to their lord, and to provide hospitality to their lord and their retinue when they visit. Depending on the specific terms of the oath, the vassal may have a specific number of knights they are required to provide when called upon, or they may be required to provide a certain number of days of service per year. For example, a baron may be required to provide 10 knights to their lord's army, with each knight being required to serve for 40 days per year, accompanied by their retainers and esquires numbering 3-10. An average knight would have a Tier 1 domain, with a size of approximately 1,500 acres. This means a 6 mile hex could contain approximately 10-15 knights' domains.

A ruler or vassal may have multiple vassals, and a vassal may have multiple vassals of their own. This nested hierarchy of vassals is known as ***feudalism***. The vassal will be given a title by their lord which is of a lesser rank than their lord's title. For example, a king may have a duke as a vassal, who in turn has a count as a vassal, who in turn has a baron as a vassal, and so on. An individual may be a vassal to multiple lords at the same time if they hold multiple titles, but they may only have one liege lord to whom they owe military service. For example a king may be the ruler of their own realm, but also hold the title of Duke in another realm, and be a vassal to that realm's king. In this case, the king would owe military service to their liege lord for their lands in the duchy, but their sovereign lands would be exempt from this.

The following are an example of titles from highest to lowest ranking in a feudal hierarchy: Emperor/High King, King/Grand Duke/Archduke, Prince/Duke, Margrave/Landgrave, Count/Earl, Baron, Knight. Only some of these titles may be present in a given realm, and some realms may have additional titles not listed here.
## Factions
Running an open-ended and living world requires a lot of moving parts. Factions are a way to keep track of the various groups and organizations that exist in the world, and how they interact with the PCs and each other.

A Faction can be any kind of group: armies, adventuring guilds, religious orders, groups of scholars, etc. The arbiter manages their movement between sessions, adjusting their interests and actions based on the current landscape of the world around them.

Each Faction is described by a summary of who they are and their interests, a couple of NPCs to represent their members, and their ***Resources*** and ***Goals***.
### Resources
These represent the assets the Faction can employ to push its agenda: people, equipment, knowledge, etc. Each faction should start with 2-4 Resources, with 2 being a small group still building its power, and 4 being a well-established force to be respected. Factions with at least 3 Resources have enough numbers and/or assets to form Detachments.

As the Faction furthers its Goals, it will acquire new Resources or empower its existing ones. At the same time, the Resources can be weakened or lost if the Faction is attacked.
### Goals
These are the objectives the Faction is working towards at the moment: each of them requires a certain amount of ***Progress*** to be achieved, ranging from 4 to 12 depending on the complexity.
- ***4 Progress*** - Goals that are quite simple and immediate to achieve, needing mostly time and effort to be applied.
- ***6 Progress*** - Goals that are still simple, but might require some tricky steps to be completed.
- ***8 Progress*** - Complex Goals, needing multiple steps, knowledge, and preparation to be achieved.
- ***12 Progress*** - Goals truly difficult to achieve, requiring a long time, hard work, and caution. Once achieved, they cause major changes on the landscape around the Faction.

### The Faction Turn
Between sessions, the arbiter will roll for the Progress of each Faction's Goals. It's up to you if that will happen after every session, depending on how fast you want things to change, but it's recommended that the Faction Turn should happen once every 1-2 weeks of in-game time.

During the Faction Turn, a Faction will choose to focus on one of its Goals, and then gather a pool of ***d6s***:
- Add 1d6 to the pool for each Resource useful to achieve the Goal.
- Add or subtract 1d6 if the Faction is on an advantageous or precarious position due to external reasons (e.g. the PCs are helping them, or their target is inaccessible).
- If another Faction is the target of the Goal, subtract 1d6 for each Resource the target has to protect itself.

Roll all dice gathered: ***each dice that shows 4-6*** marks 1 Progress towards the Goal.

***If a Faction has no dice to roll***, they fail to make Progress in this Faction Turn.
### Completing a Goal
When a Faction completes a Goal, add a new Resource or rewrite an existing one to represent its increase in power. Equally, if it targeted another Faction, the target loses or rewrites a Resource to represent its losses.

Such changes should be noticed in the game, either through gossip, rumors, or visible events.

An example of a Faction follows, containing all the elements described above.
### Children of the Moon
***A tribe of goblins infesting an old abandoned mill, having repurposed the millstone as an altar. They are led by an enigmatic human mage named Miroslav, who believes the moon is the source of truth and power. The tribe will convert people to their faith through any means necessary.***

#### Resources
- Goblin shamans imbued with the power of the moon.
- A terrifying presence among the local human villages.
- A skilled yet mad mage as their leader, wielding an unknown power.

#### Goals
- (0/6) - Grow the tribe's members.
- (0/8) - Attack the Black Eye tribe and take their territory.
- (0/12) - Sacrifice the entire populace of a local town to the moon.

#### NPCs
