# Non Player Characters
The allies and adversaries PCs can encounter are described using the following statistics:
- *Skill* - An NPC’s Strength, Dexterity and Willpower distilled into one value. The arbiter uses this for any save the NPC needs to make. Skill can't be higher than 18. Retainers use the full 3 attributes like PCs.
- *Hit Dice (HD)* - The amount of d8s rolled to determine stamina. Can multiply the number of Hit Dice by 4 to get an average number of stamina.
- *Armor Value (AV)* - The amount of damage an NPC can take before it starts losing stamina. Humanoids can have a max of 4 AV.
- *Morale (ML)* - An NPC’s odds of giving up during battle.
- Possible *attacks* and/or *special abilities* the NPC might have. 

NPCs cannot push themselves and non-retainers cannot gain stress.

For more details on how to use these statistics, see [Combat](how-to-play.md#combat).
## Reaction
When an NPC’s reaction to encountering the PCs is not obvious, roll 2d6 and consult the table below.

| 2d6   | Reaction    |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 2-3   | Hostile     |
| 4-5   | Unfriendly  |
| 6-8   | Indifferent |
| 9-10  | Friendly    |
| 11-12 | Helpful     |

## Converting OSR Monsters
To quickly convert monster stats from another OSR system that uses a Hit Die system similar to the early editions of D&D, do the following:
- Add 7 to its HD to create its Skill value. Skill can't be higher than 18.
- Determine its Armor Value (AV) based on the type (heavy, medium, light, etc.) it would be wearing, or its ability to soak damage.
- Use the listed damage values, or base off of the equipment table.
- Special abilities (immunities, spells, etc.) vary a lot between monsters so just use what seems appropriate or take some extra time to come up with a good alternative.

This is of course a simplified approach so don’t be afraid to tinker with any of these values if it will make encountering the NPC more interesting.
