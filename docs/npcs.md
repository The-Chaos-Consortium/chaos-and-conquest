# Non Player Characters
The allies and adversaries PCs can encounter are described using the following statistics:
- *Skill* - An NPC’s Strength, Dexterity and Willpower distilled into one value. The arbiter uses this for any save the NPC needs to make. Skill can't be higher than 18. Hired help use the full 3 attributes like PCs.
- *Hit Dice (HD)* - The amount of d8s rolled to determine stamina. Can multiply the number of Hit Dice by 4 to get an average number of stamina.
- *Armor Value (AV)* - The amount of damage an NPC can take before it starts losing stamina. Humanoids can have a max of 4 AV.
- *Morale (ML)* - An NPC’s odds of giving up during battle.
- Possible *attacks* and/or *special abilities* the NPC might have. 

NPCs cannot push themselves and non-retainers cannot gain stress.

For more details on how to use these statistics, see [Combat](how-to-play.md#combat).
## Reaction
When an NPC’s reaction to encountering the PCs is not obvious, roll 2d6 and consult the table below.

| 2d6   | Reaction    |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 2-3   | Hostile     |
| 4-5   | Unfriendly  |
| 6-8   | Indifferent |
| 9-10  | Friendly    |
| 11-12 | Helpful     |

## Hired Help
Difficult as it is to imagine anyone willingly subjecting themselves to be under the employ of an adventurer, such strange occurrences do happen, and with alarming frequency too! A good thing, then, for without the exploitation of human capital no adventurer could ever hope for even a modicum of success.

There are four different categories of hired help.
### Hirelings
NPCs can be hired to help PC’s during their adventures. Hirelings will go on adventures with a PC, but will not participate in combat. Each PC can hire a number of hirelings up to their WIL score.

Hirelings, unless otherwise noted, have a 6 in each attribute, 6 Morale, 1d8 stamina and 10 inventory slots. A hireling can be hired for the price listed in the table below.
1. *Porter*: Will bear torches, shields, and any other equipment or luggage a PC chooses to saddle them with.
2. *Teamster*: Drives vehicles in the wilderness and secures the load of pack animals. Pack animals that are not being ridden have an extra 10 inventory slots, and vehicles are less likely to be damaged. A teamster can manage up to 10 animals at once.
3. *Explorer*: When traveling with the party in an area with which they are familiar, the navigation check is skipped. They will also note any points of interest and answer questions about the area.

### Retainers
Retainers are NPCs who will delve into dungeons to adventure and engage in combat. A retainer can be hired for a monthly wage (see table below) and at least a *1/5th share* of whatever treasure the party obtains. When receiving this 1/5th share of treasure, the hireling also receives an equal amount of XP. This will mean retainers level up much slower than PCs. You can also pay a retainer extra, and they will gain XP equivalent to the amount of extra shillings paid. 

Upon leveling up they follow the same advancement rules as PCs. *A retainer can never be a higher Level than you*. They will leave your service if they somehow become a higher Level.

To create a retainer roll a 3d6 to determine each attribute, give them 1d8 stamina and a d6 dmg weapon. A retainer has 10 inventory slots. Experienced retainers might possess spells and a higher Skill, at the arbiter’s discretion. If they possess spells, they cast with the same system as the PC and can gain stress and roll a Mishap.

Each PC can hire a number of retainers up to their WIL score divided by 4, rounded down.

If you wish to play a retainer after a PC death,  either pick an appropriate background for its talents, or work with the arbiter to create 3 talents for the new PC if they do not already have talents.

|  15+  |     +1,000      |

### Mercenaries
Mercenaries are hired soldiers who will not go into dungeons, but will form detachments, go to battle, and serve in expeditions. A PC or retainer can take the role of any officer in a detachment. There is no limit on the number of mercenaries a PC may employ.
- 10 mercenaries make a *squad*.
- 20 mercenaries make a *section*; in addition, there must be a *sergeant*.
- 40 mercenaries make a *platoon*; in addition, there must be a *lieutenant*, and two *sergeants*.
- 80 mercenaries make a *company*; in addition, there must be a *captain*, two *lieutenants*, and four *sergeants*.
- A *general* leads two or more *companies*.
- Battle prices are double the normal rate listed.
- A dedicated *armorer* is required per 50 troops.
- Mercenaries usually have weapons and armor already when hired. Their employer can provide additional gear.
- The monthly wage does not include food and basic gear. Rations and upkeep cost 10s per month per mercenary.

### Specialists
Specialists do not go on adventures, instead remaining in a settlement and performing specific functions. *Unlike other retainers, there is no limit on the number of specialists a character may employ*. Specialists are listed in order of rarity, in order to facilitate random determination when necessary.
1. *Laborer*: Perform manual labor, such as building structures, harvesting resources, clearing obstructions, etc. One laborer is required per 250s cost of the project.
2. *Bard*: Can spread rumors, potentially making it easier to hire retainers or counteract the negative effects of treating retainers poorly.
3. *Sailor*: Needed to crew marine vessels for sailing. Each crew needs a *captain*. Any time a ship ventures beyond sight of a coastline, it becomes lost if a *navigator* is not aboard.
4. *Surveyor*: Needed to survey an area during expeditions.
5. *Animal Handler*: Can train animals.
6. *Armorer*: Per month, an armorer can make 80s worth of weapons, armor, or shields. Armor more expensive than this can be worked towards over multiple months, with the 80s being applied towards the cost. They can also maintain mercenaries’ gear. A dedicated armorer is required per 50 troops. 200s worth of equipment can be produced and 125 mercenaries’ gear maintained if 3 assistants are hired. 320s worth of equipment can be produced and 200 mercenaries’ gear maintained if 6 assistants are hired. An armorer cannot manage more than 6 assistants.
7. *Assistant Armorer*: Apprentices who work under an *armorer*. They increase the rate of production for an armorer.
8. *Craftsman*: Can craft items based on their profession.
9. *Advocate*: Necessary to bring a legal trial to action or to mount a defence. Each additional advocate adds +1 to the roll, to a max of 3.
10. *Physician*: Can treat one disease or serious wound per week.
11. *Scholar*: Can conduct investigations. Each additional scholar that is engaged to investigate the same topic  adds +1 to the roll for investigation attempts, to a max of +3.
12. *Spy*: Allows for the target on whom they are spying to become a source for investigations. Each additional spy that is engaged to spy on the same target adds +1 to the roll for investigation attempts, to a max of +3.
13. *Engineer*: Plan and oversee large construction projects such as domain building. One engineer is required per 50,000s cost of the project.
14. *Alchemist*: Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost. An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.
15. *Sage*: Sages are very rare individuals who devote their lives to the study of obscure knowledge. A sage may be consulted to answer unusual questions. The referee must judge the time and cost required to research the answer to a question. There is never a 100% chance of success in finding an answer.
16. *Assassin*: Individuals trained in the art of death. Their price will depend on the job - who the target is, preferred method of death, and many more factors.

Retainers marked with an ✝ can be hired daily at 1/10 of the monthly wage per day.

Prices do not include room, board, supplies, etc.
## Converting OSR Monsters
To quickly convert monster stats from another OSR system that uses a Hit Die system similar to the early editions of D&D, do the following:
- Add 7 to its HD to create its Skill value. Skill can't be higher than 18.
- Determine its Armor Value (AV) based on the type (heavy, medium, light, etc.) it would be wearing, or its ability to soak damage.
- Use the listed damage values, or base off of the equipment table.
- Special abilities (immunities, spells, etc.) vary a lot between monsters so just use what seems appropriate or take some extra time to come up with a good alternative.

This is of course a simplified approach so don’t be afraid to tinker with any of these values if it will make encountering the NPC more interesting.
## Some NPCs
Here are some examples you can use in your game. You are encouraged to make up your own or borrow from games you like.
