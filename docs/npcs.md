# Non Player Characters
The allies and adversaries PCs can encounter are described using the following statistics:
- ***Attributes*** - An NPC’s Strength, Dexterity and Willpower. When not explicitly defined, assume a score of 10. The arbiter uses these for any save the NPC needs to make. Attributes can't be higher than 18. 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.
- ***Stamina*** - A measure of one's ability to avoid life-threatening harm. Stamina can be one's ability to absorb physical damage, or cunning and skill in avoiding harm. Max stamina is 30.
- ***Armor Value (AV)*** - The amount of damage an NPC can take before it starts losing stamina. Humanoids can have a max of 4 AV, while creatures can have up to 6 AV.
- ***Morale (ML)*** - An NPC’s odds of giving up during battle. Ranges from 2 (will give up at the first sign of danger) to 12 (will fight to the death always).
- Possible ***attacks (ATK)*** and/or ***special abilities (SPL)*** the NPC might have. Some may be triggered upon the target failing a save against ***critical damage (CRIT)***.

NPCs cannot push themselves and non-retainers cannot gain stress.

For more details on how to use these statistics, see [Combat](how-to-play.md#combat-1).
## Reaction
When an NPC’s reaction to encountering the PCs is not obvious, roll 2d6 and consult the table below.

| 2d6   | Reaction    |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 2-3   | Hostile     |
| 4-5   | Unfriendly  |
| 6-8   | Indifferent |
| 9-10  | Friendly    |
| 11-12 | Helpful     |

## Converting OSR Monsters
To quickly convert monster stats from another OSR system that uses a Hit Die system similar to the early editions of D&D, do the following:
- Give 1 stamina per HD for most creatures. Most humanoids have at least 4 stamina. Give average creatures 3 stamina, give hardy ones 6 stamina, and serious threats get 10+ stamina.
- Determine its Armor Value (AV) based on the type (heavy, medium, light, etc.) it would be wearing, or its ability to soak damage.
- Use the listed damage values, or base off of the equipment table. Attacks do at least d6 damage, and multiple attacks should be converted to blast damage. Be careful with attacks that use multiple dice, as they can be very deadly.
- Special abilities (immunities, spells, etc.) vary a lot between monsters so just use what seems appropriate or take some extra time to come up with a good alternative.
- Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
- Strong creatures will have a high STR, nimble creatures a high DEX, and magical or charismatic creatures a high WIL.

This is of course a simplified approach so don’t be afraid to tinker with any of these values if it will make encountering the NPC more interesting.
