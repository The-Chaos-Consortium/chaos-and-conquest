# Character Creation
## Character Attributes
Each player character (PC) has three attributes.
- Strength (STR) - Physical strength, endurance and fighting.
- Dexterity (DEX) - Grace, finesse and reflexes.
- Willpower (WIL) - Magic, charisma and mental endurance.

For each of these ***roll 3d6*** to determine each of your PCâ€™s attribute scores. This will give a range of ***3 to 18*** for each attribute, with ***10*** being average. You may swap two attribute scores of your choice.
## Stamina, Inventory Slots, Corruption
Each PC starts with ***1d6 stamina***, a measure of your ability to avoid life-threatening harm.

Note the number of ***inventory slots*** your PC has. PCs have slots equal to ***their STR or 10, whichever is higher***. Inventory slots are used to carry items and to track the amount of ***stress*** a PC accumulates.

The max corruption a PC can have before being lost is equal to ***WIL+3***.
## Background & Belongings
PCs start with ***two Supplies*** (see [Equipment](equipment.md#supply)), a ***torch***, and a ***dagger***.

***Roll 6d6x10*** to determine your starting silver pennies. You may use this to buy additional equipment if you like.

Either, roll a ***d20*** to randomly [determine a background](backgrounds/README.md), or pick a specific background from the available options.
## Name, Age, & Experience
Name your character. Pick an age no younger than 18, or roll 2d10 + 16 for a random age. Choose a sex for your PC, and mark down your experience as Novice on your character sheet.
## Faction
There is a constant cosmic war between the forces of ***Chaos***, ***Law***, and the ***Balance*** between them. Chaos and Law are neither good or evil - they are beyond such human concepts. Without the Balance, the equilibrium would be tipped, and the universe would be threatened with extinction.
### Chaos
Chaos is ***freedom*** and ***randomness***, ***creativity*** and ***art***. Chaos is in constant struggle with Law, which is seen as a shackle against freedom. Followers of Chaos believe in chance and that there is no innate order to life.
### Law
Law is ***stability*** and ***structure*** in nature, ***justice*** and ***morality*** in the world. Chaos is seen as an aberration - pure entropy that would destroy the world. Law often upholds the Balance - but not always.
### Balance
The Balance states that Chaos and Law must be ***equal forces***. Without Chaos there would be no probability, new creations, or chance. Life would stagnate and become a static wasteland. Without Law life would be an unformed infinity of raw Chaotic probability. There would be no form or structure, and all natural laws would cease to exist.
### Your Choice
You must choose which Faction you follow - ***Chaos***, ***Law***, or ***Balance***. This choice will decide which people and creatures will generally treat you as an ally, and who will treat you as an enemy. Do not publicly reveal your Faction unless you are willing to face the consequences - people will generally not reveal this choice to anyone other than close friends, allies, or family.
