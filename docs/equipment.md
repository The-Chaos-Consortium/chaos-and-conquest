# Items & Equipment
Most items take one slot to carry but some items, like weapons or armor, may take additional slots to carry. Some items like clothes or small trinkets are non-encumbering and do not take up inventory slots. These can be tracked in the notes section of your character sheet.
## Currency
Money is minted in two denominations: ***silver pennies (p)*** and ***gold marks (m)***. Coins vary slightly in size, but are approximately 19mm to 21mm in diameter - roughly the size of an American penny or nickel, but thinner. Characters are assumed to carry a small amount on their person to spend on small purchases and have the rest of their wealth stored somewhere else. Up to 500 coins may be carried on your person without taking up slots. If you wish to carry more coins, 1,000 coins of any denomination take up one slot. Consider using porters, retainers, mounts, or vehicles to carry large amounts of wealth.

Peasants will make use of pennies, and will likely never see a gold mark in their life. The middle class of merchants and tradesmen will use pennies for the bulk of transactions, and marks for major purchases. The upper class of nobles and aristocrats will use marks or lines of credit, and very rarely deal in pennies. 100 pennies are equal to 1 mark. You can convert your pennies to marks at a bank or moneychanger for a 10% fee, costing you 110 pennies for 1 mark. You can freely convert marks to pennies at a 1:100 ratio.

### Converting OSR Wealth
Many other systems such as the early editions of D&D make use of a gold standard. When converting treasure rewards from those systems simply convert 1 gold to 1 penny to get an accurate reward. This means a treasure hoard of 4,000 GP would convert to 4,000p.
## Standard of Living
The table below illustrates the varying levels of comfort that can be achieved with different amounts of income. With just one mark, a peasant can not even maintain a miserable standard of living. As adventurers begin their careers, they typically survive on a meager monthly income of a few marks - just enough to cover basic expenses like food and lodging in an inn. The bulk of wealth in society is concentrated among the elite, while the majority of the population subsists on extremely meager means.

| Standard of Living | Monthly Income |                  Common Profession                   |
| :----------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: |
|     Miserable      |      200p      |                  Serfs and peasants                  |
|       Meager       |      350p      |     Unskilled manual laborers, basic adventurers     |
|      Adequate      |  500p - 800p   | Skilled laborers, journeyman craftsmen, mercenaries  |
|    Comfortable     | 800p - 1,200p  |     Master craftsmen or yeoman farmer (85 acres)     |
|    Respectable     |     1,800p     | Master professionals or landed patrician (200 acres) |
|      Wealthy       |     3,600p     |         Courtiers, Knights, Bishops, Gentry          |
|    Minor Noble     |    12,000p     |                   Barons or Counts                   |
|    Major Noble     |    60,000p     |                   Dukes or Princes                   |
|       Royal        |   600,000p+    |                  Kings or Emperors                   |

## Settlement Types & Rarity
The size of a given area’s economy influences that type of trade that can occur in a location, which is indicated by its ***settlement type***. The criteria for determining settlement type is dependent on your campaign world and its relative level of population, but the following may serve as a general rubric:
- Tier 1 (Hamlet) - 10 or so people
- Tier 2 (Village) - 20 to 1,000 people, 50 to 300 is typical
- Tier 3 (Town) - 1,000 to 8,000 people, average of 2,500
- Tier 4 (City) - 8,000 to 12,000 people
- Tier 5 (Metropolis) - 12,000 to 100,000 people

Specialists and some items have a rarity rating between 1 and 5, corresponding to the settlement types. Items and specialists can be freely bought and hired in the settlement type they correspond to and all larger settlements (e.g. rarity 3 can be found in towns and above).

Items and specialists of a higher rarity than the settlement type one is in may potentially still be bought, sold, or hired, though it will take time, effort, and money. Items will likely have to be commissioned or haggled for, and skilled specialists specifically sought after.
## Supply
***Supply*** is an abstract item representing basic gear a PC brought with them and costs ***20p***. At any time during a session a PC may trade a Supply they carry for any simple commonly available item, which they then note in their inventory. A list of suggestions is given below, but ultimately it is up to the arbiter which items can be acquired using Supply and which should be bought separately.

Supply can also be used to ***repair armor*** and ***restore worn weapons*** during an expedition. One Supply can be used to restore 1 Armor Value or one worn weapon; this process takes one turn.

|     Examples of Supply items     |          Examples of non-Supply items           |
| :------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------: |
|             10' pole             |                Weapons and armor                |
| 3 days of rations (food & water) |                      Ammo                       |
|             Bedroll              |                      Tent                       |
|         Bag of caltrops          |                    Spyglass                     |
|        Some chalk pieces         |                    Livestock                    |
|     Crowbar or sledgehammer      |                    Vehicles                     |
|            Face paint            |   Specialized equipment, e.g. an alchemy kit.   |
|           Flask of oil           |               Musical instruments               |

|               Rope               | Anything that is not widely available and cheap |
|            Waterskin             |                                                 |

## Ammo
***Ammo*** is an abstract item representing the ammunition a PC brought with them for their weapon. Players do not keep track of individual arrows or bullets, but must ***roll a d6 at the end of combat*** in which their PC used a ranged weapon. On a ***result of 1***, they only have enough ammunition left for ***one shot*** after which the Ammo is removed from their inventory.
## Light
To light the way during the night or in dark places below the earth PCs need a light source. Each light source comes with a number of Light Points (LP) which determine how bright the light is.
- Torch - Burns for 6 turns (1 hour), 5 LP. Is more vulnerable to wind and rain, but can be used to light things.
- Lantern - Burns for 24 turns (4 hours) but requires a separate flask of oil, 2 LP. Cannot be used to easily light things, but is more resilient to wind and rain.

Tallying up the LP a party has determines the party’s light level:
- Bright - LP equal to or greater than the number of party members. The party has advantage on surprise, but cannot surprise their enemies.
- Dim - Less LP than the number of party members, but more LP than half the party size. Ranged attacks are at disadvantage.
- Darkness - LP less than half the number of party members. All attacks are at disadvantage, saves are at disadvantage, and the party is always surprised.

## Basic Gear
PCs can acquire specific items for cheaper prices than using ***Supply***. Doing this loses the flexibility of supply, but will be cheaper if you know exactly what you need.

### Silver Weapons
Silver weapons cost 10 times its base cost. Silver ammo must be purchased separately at a cost of 10p per shot. Some monsters can only be harmed by magical or silver weapons. Silver weapons are much more easily worn, so they should not be used for normal combat. After every attack with a silver weapon you must roll to see if it becomes worn. Silver ammo is rendered useless after being shot.

Prices for buildings are the costs of construction. Prices to buy are usually 2-5x (a hovel would sell for 240p-600p) depending on location, while renting would cost 10% of the construction price each year (12p/year for a hovel, 240p/year for a craftsman's house). Rarity for buildings is the settlement type in which they may be bought or rented; buildings can otherwise be built in any settlement type, provided land and labor is available. Buildings always carry their original worth for resale.
