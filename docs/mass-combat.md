# Mass Combat
## Detachments
Large groups of combatants fighting together are treated as a detachment. *Detachments must be made up of similar troops*. The officers can be equipped differently or have more hit dice, but this will not affect the stats of the detachment. The four types of detachments ranked by size are:
- Individuals
- Small Detachments - usually squad size (10+)
- Medium Detachments - usually section size (20+)
- Large Detachments - usually platoon size (40+)
- Huge Detachments - usually company size (80+)

Detachments are described using the following statistics:
- Skill - A detachment’s fighting capability distilled into one value. The arbiter uses this for any save the detachment needs to make. Skill can't be higher than 19. Skill is usually 10, but can be modified up or down depending on the detachment’s training, equipment, the WIL or Skill of the leader(s), etc.
- Hit Dice (HD) - The amount of d8s rolled to determine stamina. Can multiply the number of Hit Dice by 4 to get an average number of stamina. Is equal to the HD of a single member.
- Armor Value (AV) - The amount of damage a detachment can take before it starts losing stamina. Is equal to the lowest AV of a single member.
- Morale (ML) - A detachment’s odds of giving up during battle.
- Possible attacks and/or special abilities the detachment might have. Generally based on their equipment.

### Attacks vs. Detachments
- Individuals make impaired attacks unless they do blast damage.
- Detachments cause blast damage to individuals.
- Equal sized detachments do normal weapon damage
- When combatants of different size-classes fight, the larger combatant gains +2 AV and a +d12 bonus damage die for each step higher above their opponent's size.
- After a detachment’s stamina is reduced to 0, they drop a size and must make a morale save. On a success the HD are re-rolled and the survivors stay in the fight. On a failure the survivors either flee or surrender. A small detachment reduced to 0 stamina is wiped out.

## Mercenary Spoils and Loot
Large groups of mercenaries will usually require the right to claim spoils of war. This means that the troops will lay claim to all treasure and loot after a battlefield. The spoils are usually broken up using shares, with the officers getting more shares than a basic soldier.

|    Rank    | Shares |
| :--------: | :----: |
|  Soldier   |   1    |
|  Sergeant  |   2    |
| Lieutenant |   10   |
|  Captain   |   20   |
|  General   |   30   |

The overall leader of an army will normally get another 10 shares on top of the shares for their rank. If the leader is a Sergeant they will get 12 shares, a Lieutenant 20 shares, and so on.

If the PCs and retainers outnumber the hired mercenaries, the mercenaries will generally not force shares of the spoils.
