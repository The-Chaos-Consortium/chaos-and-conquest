# Mass Combat
## Detachments
Large groups of combatants fighting together are treated as a detachment. ***Detachments must be made up of similar troops***. The officers can be equipped differently or be a higher level, but this will not affect the stats of the detachment. The three types of detachments ranked by size are:
- Individuals
- Small Detachments - usually lance size (5)
- Medium Detachments - usually multiple lances (15)
- Large Detachments - usually contingent size (25)

Detachments are described using the following statistics:
- ***Attributes*** - A detachment's Strength, Dexterity and Willpower. When not explicitly defined, assume a score of 10. The arbiter uses these for any save the detachment needs to make. Attributes can't be higher than 18. 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary, and they can be modified up or down depending on the detachment’s training, equipment, the WIL or skill of the leader(s), etc.
- ***Level*** - The amount of d6s rolled to determine stamina. Can multiply the Level by 3 to get an average number of stamina. Is equal to the lowest Level of a single member.
- ***Armor Value (AV)*** - The amount of damage a detachment can take before it starts losing stamina. Is equal to the lowest AV of a single member.
- ***Morale (ML)*** - A detachment’s odds of giving up during battle.
- Possible ***attacks*** and/or ***special abilities*** the detachment might have. Generally based on their equipment.

### Attacks vs. Detachments
- Individuals make impaired attacks unless they do blast damage.
- Detachments cause blast damage to individuals.
- Equal sized detachments do normal weapon damage
- When combatants of different size-classes fight, the larger combatant gains +2 AV and a +d6 bonus damage die for each step higher above their opponent's size.
- After a detachment’s stamina is reduced to 0, they take any remaining damage to their STR and must make a STR save. On a success the stamina is re-rolled, the detachment drops a size, and the survivors stay in the fight. On a failure the survivors must make a morale save - failure leading them to either flee or surrender. A detachment reduced to 0 STR is wiped out. The leader must roll a DEX save upon the detachment being reduced to 0 STR. If failed, the leader is killed.

## Quick Mass Combat
For smaller scale battles the arbiter can use the above detachment rules to handle mass combat. They are perfectly usable for large scale battles as well if the group would like to actively play out the fight; while the above detachment sizes are recommended, the arbiter can use whatever detachment sizes they feel comfortable with, with large detachments being 5,000+ combatants in a Roman Legion for example.

A simplified system can be used though when the battle is too large to actively simulate, or when the arbiter wants to quickly resolve a battle. In such an engagement, each side rolls 1d6, and adds the following modifiers.
- +1 if they outnumber the enemy at all; +2 if they outnumber the enemy 2 to one; +3 if they outnumber the enemy 3 to one, and so on.
- Add the level of the highest level PC on that side, or the level of the highest threat npc.
- +1 for each significant tactical advantage, such as: cover, high ground, unbreakable formation, ambush, superior armaments, relevant magic, traps, superior training or morale, and so on.

The side that rolls the highest wins the engagement. Ties are treated as a draw.

Unless it does not make sense, the difference between the result of each side’s roll multiplied by 10 represents the percentage of casualties, losses, or severity of damage to the losing side of the engagement.

The number rolled by the losing side multiplied by 10 represents the percentage of casualties, losses, or severity of destruction to the winning side of the engagement. This means the winning side will always suffer some losses (10% - 60%) which could result in a pyrrhic victory if they lose more troops than the losing side.

Any PCs involved in the engagement make a save with their best attribute if they win or draw. If they succeed, they are unharmed; if they fail, they take damage equal to the amount they failed by.

If they lost, PCs use their worst attribute for the save. If they pass, they take damage equal to the difference between the result of each side’s roll; if they fail, they die.
